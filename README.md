# Server Monitoring System

The "Server Monitoring System" app repository utilizes Prometheus and Loki to collect and analyze metrics and logs . It incorporates Grafana to visualize this data on a user-friendly dashboard for effective monitoring of server health and performance. By leveraging Prometheus for metric scraping and storage, and Loki for log collection, the system offers comprehensive insights into system behavior and performance trends. The Grafana dashboard provides a centralized interface for monitoring key metrics and logs, empowering users to quickly identify and respond to issues, ensuring the reliability and stability of their server infrastructure.
